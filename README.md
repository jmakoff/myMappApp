To start app:
1. Type <code>npm install</code> in console in main app folder;
2. Type <code>npm start</code>(app runs on localhost:3030, so you should be sure that it is empty);
3. Go to <code>localhost:3030</code> in your browser.
4. Now you can play with my app(double click on map to make a new marker).
